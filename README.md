# Simple Backup_tool 

- In this project I created a Backup_tool which take files from 1 folder and create a backup archive and moves it to another folder 
- I created a GUI using "tkinter" library and at the end i created an exe file using pyinstaller library and the program can be used from a OS interface.
- In the future projects i will research how i can integrate a schedule time to use this program at certain periodes of time and run automatically at a given hour to make the backup file
- In the future projects i will add to the script the possibility to create the backup archive to a local network and to more than 1 computer.
- the script can be runed from Pycharm directly or from the executable file.
- We have to install the following tool:
- pip install pyinstaller (used for the creation of executable file)
